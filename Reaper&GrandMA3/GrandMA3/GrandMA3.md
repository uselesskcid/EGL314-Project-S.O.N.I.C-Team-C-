[OSC.md](https://github.com/uselesskcid/EGL314-Project-S.O.N.I.C-Team-C-POC/blob/main/Reaper%20%2B%20GrandMA3/OSC/OSC.md) - This markdown file contains relevant information about the control of GrandMA3 sequences through OSC commands from a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Overview

This markdown documentation file shows all the lighting sequences that have been programmed to supplement the environment aesthetics and appearance as well as to assist with the game flow.

## Easy Level Lighting Sequence

As seen in the above picture, the easy level lighting sequence will consist of the blue and green lights on the left and right side respectively as well as the white light in the middle, which replicates what players will see on the Launchpad Pro. This is to help players understand the layout of the environment.

## Hard Level Lighting Sequence

As seen in the above picture, the hard level lighting sequence will consist of the organe, green, pink and blue lights on the front, right, back and left sides respectively as well as the white light in the middle, which replicates what players will see on the Launchpad Pro. This is to help players understand the layout of the environment.

## Station Lighting Sequence

As seen in the above short video, the station lighting sequence will consist of 2 gobos and 1 spot lights. The first gobo, which is the dotted line, is used to guide players to the station while the second gobo, which is the spinning stars, is used as to represent a checkpoint (like in a game), so that players know where they need to stop at. The purple spot light is used to shine a little more light for players and station masters to see the poster and each other.

## Center Lighting Sequence

![Center Lighting](https://github.com/uselesskcid/EGL314-Project-S.O.N.I.C-Team-C-POC/blob/main/Reaper%26GrandMA3/GrandMA3/assets/gameseq.gif)

As seen in the above short video, the center lighting sequence will consist of 2 gobos. The first gobo, which is the dotted line, is used to guide players to the station while the second gobo, which is the spinning stars, is used as to represent a checkpoint (like in a game), so that players know where they need to stop at.

## Win Lighting Sequence

![Lose Lighting](https://github.com/uselesskcid/EGL314-Project-S.O.N.I.C-Team-C-POC/blob/main/Reaper%26GrandMA3/GrandMA3/assets/win.gif)

As seen in the above short video, the station lighting sequence will consist of 8 pulsing green lights. This is used to give players a visual cue that they have completed and win the game.

## Lose Lighting Sequence

![Lose Lighting](https://github.com/uselesskcid/EGL314-Project-S.O.N.I.C-Team-C-POC/blob/main/Reaper%26GrandMA3/GrandMA3/assets/smokefanmachine.gif)

As seen in the above short video, the station lighting sequence will consist of 8 pulsing red lights as well as smoke machine and a dmx fan being activiated. This is used to give players a visual cue that they have completed and lost the game. The smoke is implemeted as a punishment for losing the game and with the help of the fan, the smoke will be blown towards the direction of where the player is standing at high speed.

## Start Lighting Sequence

![Lose Lighting](https://github.com/uselesskcid/EGL314-Project-S.O.N.I.C-Team-C-POC/blob/main/Reaper%26GrandMA3/GrandMA3/assets/suspenseseq.gif)

As seen in the above short video, the station ighting sequence will consist of 8 random strobing white lights for 8 seconds and then the lights used for Easy Level. This is used to create suspense and help the players feel more excited to start the game and complete the activity. Because the default difficulty level of the game is easy, thus, the lighting sequence for easy level will be shown after the suspense.
