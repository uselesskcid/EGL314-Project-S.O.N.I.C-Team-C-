This markdown documentation file contains relevant information on all the sound effects and audio tracks used in the creation of an immersive soundscape.

## Audio assets

For all audio assets used, we have sourced and downloaded them from youtube. Their creators have all givien permission for the public to download and use the audio assets without any copyright infringement.

Out of all the audio assets, there are a few important ones to look out for. They are:
1. shuriken beat - this is the beat that players are supposed to localize, count, remember and input on the Launchpad
2. WIN sound effect - this the sound effect used as an audio cue to inform players that they have won the game
3. lose sound effect - this is the sound effect used an audio cue to inform players that they have lost the game
4. others - the remaining sound effects are used to layer and mix in L-ISA controller for a background soundscape
